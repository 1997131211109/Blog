# Release Branching Strategy

# 1.  We implement the scheme  Git Flow
# 1.1 We create brunch "1.1 , for the developer"
# To do this, we need to use the command in the console  "git checkout -b featur/1.0"
# Go to the created branch, and create a fail "readme.update.py"
# We transfer the data with the comit, what we did in the project to the "github"

# 2. Create a branch 1.1 in which we will describe the events further
# We create brunch "1.2 , for the For testing and improvement"
# We continue to work on our topic, our task is to show how branches work separately from the project, and then transfer the results to the project of the previous branch
# If our data is correct, then we can move it to the main branch of the project: main
