# Release Branching Strategy

# 1.  We implement the scheme  Git Flow
# 1.1 We create brunch "1.0 , for the developer"
# To do this, we need to use the command in the console  "git checkout -b featur/1.0"
# Go to the created branch, and create a fail "readme.update.py"
# We transfer the data with the comit, what we did in the project to the "github"
